Ideas:

+ Make png2art palettize images if not all ready. This will require loading a palette.
+ Also, make sure palettized images corrispond with palette.
	+ If not palettized correctly, convert image to proper palette so true-color PNGs could be used with warnings.
+ Make art2png/png2art have a single-file mode, like art2tga/tga2art only had. This is for people who want to work on one file at a time.
+ Comment code better
+ I'm planning on trying to figure out how to make use of Ken Silverman's image library rather than libfreeimage, to minimize external dependencies
